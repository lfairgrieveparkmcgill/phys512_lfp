It appears that the correlation function of the shifted gaussian essentially acts to apply the shift in the opposite direction as seen in the figure.

This isn’t surprising. The correlation function essentially sweeps the gaussian from left to right over the other gaussian with the value representative of the overlapping regions as a function of k steps. By shifting the gaussian right, it will overlap with the gaussian “sooner” as it is swept from left to right, shifting the correlation function to the left. Damn this is hard to explain in words…. Go to this link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocorrelation#/media/File:Comparison_convolution_correlation.svg and look at the autocorrelation function and it makes more sense. If the red curve is shifted right the corr function is shifted left respectively.
