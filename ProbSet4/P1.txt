old param chisq is  15267.937968222595  for  2501  degrees of freedom.
chi square is 2.5523666469857247 standard deviations from the mean

2.5 standard deviations from the mean for the old params is not a very good fit (approx 0.5 percentile), implication is model is likely incorrect.

new param chisq is  3272.2033778089576  for  2501  degrees of freedom.
chi square is 0.15417900396020745 standard deviations from the mean

0.15 standard deviations fro the mean for the new params is an acceptable fit (approx 45 percentile).
